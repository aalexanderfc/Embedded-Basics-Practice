# Practice Project

This repository contains a simple practice project for learning and experimenting with basic programming concepts in embedded systems. The project is designed to help beginners get familiar with coding, setting up a microcontroller, and using sensors or other peripherals.

## Features

- **Basic Microcontroller Setup**: Learn how to set up and configure a microcontroller for different tasks.
- **Simple Sensor Integration**: Integrate basic sensors to collect data, such as temperature or light levels.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Provides a simple environment for experimenting with microcontroller programming and sensor integration.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, STM32, or Arduino)
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (for ESP32/Arduino)
  - Necessary libraries for any connected sensors

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aalexanderfc/Uppgift_4.git
   cd Uppgift_4
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   - For Arduino IDE, open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - For PlatformIO, open the project folder in VS Code.

3. **Connect Your Hardware**:
   - Connect your sensors or components to the microcontroller according to the pin configurations specified in the code.

4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Connect your microcontroller to your computer via USB.
   - Compile and upload the code to your board.

## Usage

- **Experiment with Code**: Modify the code to understand how each part affects the overall function of the microcontroller.
- **Data Collection**: Use the connected sensors to collect basic environmental data and observe the results.

## How It Works

This project allows users to practice writing code for microcontrollers, setting up peripherals, and reading sensor data:

- **Basic Concepts**: Learn how to initialize a microcontroller, set up GPIO pins, and write loops to handle sensor data.
- **Sensor Integration**: Simple sensors can be connected to demonstrate how data is read and processed.

## Example Code

Here is a brief example of what the code looks like:

```cpp
void setup() {
    // Setup code for initializing microcontroller and sensors
}

void loop() {
    // Main loop code for reading sensor data and performing actions
}
```

For detailed code, please refer to the specific `.ino` file in the repository.

## Limitations

- This is a basic practice project, intended for learning purposes only.
- Limited functionality and features compared to more complex embedded projects.
